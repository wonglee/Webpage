        <h2> The Loss of Gotham </h2>
        <p>
          The Loss of Gotham is a first person horror, exploration game where the player has to collect certain keys to progress while having to occationally pick up air filters to survive. This Game was built over a 4 week period and it was one of my first 3D projects.

        <p> Our Team consisted of 3 members, a team lead, a programmer and a modeler.
        </p>
        <p> As the programmer, I managed the game file and to add all assets to the scene. I also created several puzzles such as the pressure plate puzzle where the player has to place a certain amount of weight to open the door.
        </p>
        <p> One challenged I faced was developing on the 3D engine, I had no prior expereince but I followed tutorials and figured out the most of the basics like movement and using 3D colliders. One other challenge faced was developping the AI for the enemy, I had an idea of how it worked where the AI have a state machine to determine what it is doing and its movement is predefined using waypoints. The problem I encounted within the AI was the detection if the player was in the AI's view, This problem was resovled after several testing using transform.rotation and quaternion calculation to determine if the player is at the correct angle relative to the enemy. The Experience learned here was very helpful and game me a good understanding about developping in the 3D game engine

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="cell">
        <p> Through the process of developing our game, we learned a lot about the importance of playtesting. While we were designing the levels and gameplay, our vision of one level did not necessarily translate onto the playtesters. For example, in the earlier prototypes, we made the atmosphere of a level really dark to emphasize the horror element of our game. However, when we did the playtesting, we found out that the darkness actually hindered the playtesters ability to play the game as it was too dark and they could not see a thing. From that point on, we learned to playtest as much as possible in order to see if our iterations work and prevent any player frustrations.
