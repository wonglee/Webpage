        <p> The Team consist of two programmer, an artist and a puzzle designer. As a group, we wanted to make the sidescroller unique by allowing the player to change shape
          while each one have an advantage and disadvantage. We also wanted our game to run on mobile devices where the user is able to easily control the character without
          issues.
        </p>
        <p> We were inspired by Limbo and Inside and our theme takes place in a forest where the world is in chaos. The player must find their family while navigating through different puzzles. We wanted to reward the player who explore by adding collectable gems.

      <p> I worked on some of the game mechanics including parallax background, moving platforms that the player moves with, button triggers and finally porting the game over to mobile. One challenge I found was that this was the first mobile game I developed and had some trouble getting controls brought over.</p>
