      <p>
        Beep is a 3D third person adventure game about an alien that crash lands onto an unfamiliar and hostile planet.
        As the alien, the player can shapeshift to look like the enemy, sneak around, interact with objects, and solve puzzles.
        The game plays on the themes of discrimination and changing yourself to fit in.

        <p> The Team consist of two programmers and three artists. Individually, each team was responsible for specific types of tasks.
          Both teams worked together to define the general narrative, themes, and gameplay. Collaboration between the teams was very important,
          we work together cohesively in a large group with clear, subdivided roles to improve our overall workflow and project pipeline.

      <p> For this project I worked focused on the AI, how the AI detects the player and how they navigate around the environment. </p>
      <p> I also looked at different feasible shaders, camera work and developing tools for non-developers as by creating prefabs and adjustable settings on scripts,
        the art team is able to freely explore different combinations that affect the gameplay and level design.</p>
