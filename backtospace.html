      <p>
        Back to Space, a virtual reality simulation game, produced for our class, Interactive Arts and Technology 445, Immersive Environments.
        Our project is a first person puzzle open exploratory world space simulation where the user, playing a character named John, must find a
        way to save themselves when things take a fatal twist on their spacecraft.

        <p> The Team consist of one programmer, two 3D modelers and a documentor. As a group, we decided to make this project an introduction to further
          levels that we plan on building past this semester.  It designed to teach the basics to our players and give our project some exposure to the general public.
        </p>
        <p> We were greatly inspired by sci-fi cult classics, like Star Trek and Star Wars, as well as newer space themed
movies, such as Gravity and Interstellar. Our vision was to create an environment where people could
immersively experience these fantastic fandoms all in one world. We can't all be astronauts and we can't all live
out our fantasy Star Trek lives, but this is something that we hope sci-fi fans can use to get one step closer to
space.

      <p> As the only progammer, I populated the 3D enviornment as well as created the experience. I created different rooms where the player has to navigate through the enviornment
        in order to progress the story and complete complex puzzles. </p>
